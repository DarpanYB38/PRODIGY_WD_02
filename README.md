# 🚀 Features
Start, Stop, and Reset functionalities: Provides smooth controls for tracking time.
Precise timing: Uses setInterval() to track time down to milliseconds.
Minimalistic and User-Friendly UI: A clean, intuitive design for a better user experience.
Responsive Design: Works perfectly across various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
